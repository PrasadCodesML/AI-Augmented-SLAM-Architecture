# AI-Augmented-SLAM-Architecture

Current mapping and navigation systems, while highly efficient, typically rely on traditional SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques that focus solely on sensor data for mapping and navigation. 

These systems lack the ability to store, recall, and reason over past environmental interactions.

Generative AI can be a game-changer by introducing an advanced memory and reasoning layer to these systems. 

This project, leverages Generative AI to enhance the capabilities of SLAM systems using the ReMEmbR (Recurrent Memory Embedding and Reasoning) architecture, enabling robots to build long-term memories, understand spatial relationships over time, and make intelligent decisions based on both real-time and stored data. 

By integrating Generative AI with ROS2 and the Nav2 stack, the system will simulate autonomous navigation that is more adaptable, intelligent, and capable of handling dynamic environments.
